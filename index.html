          <p>I only really started coding in September of 2021. I had enrolled in a Web Development course at SAIT which
            had ended in December 2021. Since then, I haven't coded as much as I would have liked, but I'm starting to
            get back into the swing of things.</p>

          <p>I really enjoy that I can just throw on some music and be in my own head space. Coding is really mentally
            challenging at times and I believe that is a good thing. I like learning new things and throwing myself at
            new challenging opportunities.</p>
